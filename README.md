          🩺 Breast Cancer Diagnosis Predictor

🧠 Overview: 

The Breast Cancer Diagnosis Predictor is a machine learning–powered web application built using Streamlit.
It predicts whether a breast tumor is Benign (0) or Malignant (1) based on 30 diagnostic features extracted from digitized images of Fine Needle Aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.

This project follows an industry-standard ML workflow:

1.Experimentation & hyperparameter tuning in Jupyter Notebook

2.Model comparison using consistent evaluation metrics

3.Best model selection based on test accuracy

4.Modular deployment of the selected model in a Streamlit application

🎯 Project Objective

To evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms using hyperparameter tuning, identify the best-performing model based on accuracy, and deploy the selected model using modular and production-ready code.

🚀 Key Features:

✅ Interactive slider + numeric inputs for all features

📊 Features grouped into:

1.Mean features

2.Standard Error features

3.Worst-case features

🧪 Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV) for multiple algorithms

🏆 Automatic best model selection based on test accuracy

📈 Visualized performance metrics:

‣ Accuracy

‣ Precision

‣ Recall

‣ F1 Score

🔍 Live predictions with confidence score

🧩 Clean modular coding structure

🤖 Machine Learning Models Evaluated

The following algorithms were trained and tuned during experimentation:

‣ Logistic Regression

‣ Random Forest

‣ Support Vector Machine (SVM)

‣ AdaBoost

‣ XGBoost

‣ CatBoost

After hyperparameter tuning and evaluation, the model with the highest test accuracy was selected and deployed.

🧠 Model Selection Strategy

All models were trained using the same preprocessing pipeline and evaluated using identical metrics to ensure a fair comparison.

Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV

Evaluation was done on a held-out test set

The model with the highest test accuracy was selected as the final model

Only the best model was used in the deployed application

This separation of experimentation (Jupyter Notebook) and deployment (modular code) follows real-world ML best practices.
